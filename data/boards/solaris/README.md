## Special Instructions:

The Ishiyama set is made up of 49 boards of size 10x10. These are modular and are intended to be arranged randomly (by
using the Surprise option). The recommended game size is 3x3 to 5x5 boards depending on the number and type of meks. If
playing with Double Blind rules (highly recommended!) it's best not to go beyond 4x4 boards.

The Colosseum set is made up of 20 boards, representing a variety of different arrangements for the various moving
parts (these are fixed for each board because MM doesn't __yet__ support dynamic terrain features). Pick one at random.
