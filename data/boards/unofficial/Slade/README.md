# Slade

The file `auxiliarymaps.zip` contains:

`devilsrun.board` - Ever wish you had a place to negate the reach of Clan weapons? Try this board on for size. No place
to run flat out, no place to hit you from clear across the board. It's all about partial cover and vicious alpha strikes
when you step around that blind corner.

`sherwoodforest.board` - Hey Sheriff!  I hope you packed for upclose fighting. With no reaches for long range weapons,
it's all speed and hard hitting that will carry the day.

`siege_topleft.board`, `siege_topmiddle.board`, `siege_topright.board` - Campaign Maps. To load, you'll be running 3x1.
Plenty of room to run, but it will get tight once you get to company levels. Boards can be used separately as well.

`siege_bottomright.board`, `siege_bottommiddle.board`, `siege_bottomleft.board` - Campaign Maps. Again, load 3x1.

## Full Siege

- Load 3x2. Definitely able to support a battalion campaign.

`convoy1.board` & `convoy2.board` - A useful 2x1 map system for campaigns involving getting your meks/vehicles from
point A (NW corner) to point B (NE corner). There's plenty to do for both the ambushers and ambushees.
