# RossMaps

Thanks for playing my maps!  The 2013 edition has maps that I've made from 2003- September 2013. I've had to go back and
edit some of the older ones due to how MegaMek shows `0` level swamps and trees as well as some of the planted field
options. All files have been updated as best I can with either planted fields to replace swamps (standing in for grass
and giving infantry some cover and breaking up LOS) or the full removal of the offending hexes.

Any map that has the RW tag means it's a map that I've made from a real world (aka, 2011-2013 Google Earth map.) Three
of them come from western Oklahoma, where I grew up hunting and fishing. Another one comes from Colorado, while a final
one from east Texas. I'm sure the scale is off, but I've found it enjoyable to play in places I know exist, for real and
not just some random hexes tossed down for the heck of it. Don't get caught up in the scale, just enjoy!

I hope you find ways to make use of my maps in your games or campaigns!  Thanks for using them!
