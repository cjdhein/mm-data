<capabilities>
LBX-class field guns are frequently deployed in the anti-aircraft and anti-vehicle roles due to their improved range and ability to fire cluster munitions. The higher costs compared to conventional autocannon is one of the few things preventing them from becoming the defacto standard.

<overview>
Infantry are one of the most underserved branches in the DCMS.  Receiving little in the way of training or equipment they are left as garrison forces protecting stockpiles and camps while the mechanized forces take the fight to the enemy.  Offensive use is frequently limited to sacrificial holding actions enabling heavier forces to reposition or withdraw.  The horror of encountering Clan Elementals resulted in minor equipment improvements, with the bulk of infantry development work seeking to counter Clan battle armor with their own models.
