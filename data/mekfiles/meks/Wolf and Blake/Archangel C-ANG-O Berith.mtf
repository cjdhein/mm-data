overview:Debuting in 3069, the Celestial series of OmniMechs are engineered to be used by the elite Word of Blake Manei Domini troops.
capabilities:The Archangel is the largest of these. Designed to be an "anchor" for Word formations, the 'Mech is known as a "zombie" because of its ability to take extreme amounts of damage and continue operating. The Archangel features a compact fusion engine, compact gyro, a small cockpit, and nineteen and a half tons of standard armor, which frees up a large amount of internal space, while an Endo Steel frame opens up free tonnage, making heavier components possible. A C3i Computer helps direct and coordinate fire.
history:The customized configuration of the Manei Domini's feared Precentor Berith features a mix of advanced & experimental technologies only enhanced by his VDNI link. Carrying an all energy weapons array, its primary weapons are a Heavy PPC and twin Light PPCs each fitted with capacitors, supported by a Medium Variable Speed Pulse Laser and a Snub-Nose PPC.
