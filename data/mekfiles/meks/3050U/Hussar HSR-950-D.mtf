overview:The Hussar stands as a hallmark reconnaissance platform within the realms of the Star League Defense Force (SLDF), with its ability to achieve top speeds surpassing 150 kph. This speed advantage rendered the Hussar a challenging target in direct confrontations on the battlefield. Although modern designs have surfaced over time, the Hussar continues to embody the quintessence of a light recon BattleMech. The initial utilization of Hussar by the original SLDF in light 'Mech formations led to its scarce presence among the Great Houses, a scenario exacerbated post the historical Exodus led by General Kerensky.
capabilities:The Hussar, though notably under-armored when juxtaposed against other recon designs, wasn't crafted to thrive in one-on-one combat scenarios. Its principal design featured an extended-range large laser, a component allowing it to engage adversaries from a long-range distance. The essence of the Hussar’s advantage is rooted in its speed, a fact often overlooked by Lyran pilots, particularly the inexperienced ones accustomed to heavier designs, leading to a significant pilot mortality rate.
deployment:An upgrade of the 900-D produced for the Blakists in 3070, the 950-D is built on a standard frame, but with the equipment replaced with two ER medium lasers and a snub-nose PPC. This variant has the most armor of any Hussar variant thanks to its use of a heavy ferro-fibrous weave armor.
history:The legacy of the Hussar traces back to its pivotal role within the SLDF as a reconnaissance stalwart. The scarcity of this design among the Great Houses became more pronounced post General Kerensky’s Exodus, leading to its classification as a lost design until its revival by the Com Guards in 3051. The subsequent acquisition of the Hussar design by Coventry Metal Works from Bonn Mekarmorwerks marked a new chapter, leading to the development of new variants between 3055 and 3068. The narrative of the Hussar took a dire turn with the onset of the Jihad, as the Word of Blake’s assault on Coventry halted further advancements and shipments of this iconic design.
