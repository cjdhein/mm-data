overview:The Albatross, designed by the Free Worlds League in 3053 in anticipation of a potential conflict with the advancing Clans, is a versatile workhorse 'Mech that does not specialize in one specific role.
capabilities:Weighing 95 tons, it is one of House Marik's heaviest 'Mechs and utilizes a GM 380 XL engine, enabling speeds of up to 65 kph. To prioritize weapon capacity, the designers opted against incorporating an endo steel chassis or ferro-fibrous armor. The Albatross boasts impressive weaponry designed for various engagement ranges. It features an LRM rack and extended-range lasers for potent long-range firepower, while a combination of an autocannon and lasers effectively engages foes at closer distances. For opponents closing in, MechWarriors can employ the SRMs. With thirteen tons of armor, the Albatross offers enhanced battlefield survivability, though it is prone to overheating. Additionally, the 'Mech incorporates CASE technology for safeguarding against ammunition explosions.
deployment:Precentor Dantalion of the 49th Shadow Division made enhancements to his personal 'Mech, incorporating experimental equipment. These modifications include a Small Cockpit to accommodate a Laser AMS in the head, a Heavy-Duty Gyro and Light Engine to improve survivability, and the implementation of Heavy Ferro-Fibrous armor for increased protection. The Albatross also features a Guardian ECM Suite to defend against enemy electronics. In terms of offensive capabilities, Dantalion's custom Albatross is armed with an ER PPC with PPC Capacitor in the left arm, complemented by a Large VSP Laser in the right. Close combat capabilities are provided by an ER medium laser and Medium Pulse Laser in both the left and right torso, along with an additional ER Small Laser mounted in the right torso. The integration of Triple Strength Myomer enhances the 'Mech's effectiveness in melee combat, making it a formidable adversary.
history:Following its commissioning, the first Albatross 'Mech rolled off the production line in 3053, becoming the signature 'Mech of the Knights of the Inner Sphere rather than being distributed among regular line units. As Operation Guerrero and the counterassault against the Clans unfolded, the Albatross saw increased deployment. While primarily limited to prestigious Free Worlds League Military (FWLM) units, a small number were exported to close League allies. Initially, the Albatross symbolized a bright future as the distinguished BattleMech of the noble Knights of the Inner Sphere. However, with the fall of the Knights and their ideals early in the Jihad, the Albatross became associated with the shame and fracture of the Free Worlds League rather than a symbol of renewal. Despite this tarnished reputation, the Albatross remained a formidable presence on the battlefield, with Irian BattleMechs producing various variants for the Army of the Marik-Stewart Commonwealth (AMSC), although export sales were limited. The Albatross demonstrated mobility and power, albeit with a reputation for being temperamental. Its solid performance during the doomed AMSC campaign against Operation Hammerfall helped restore some of its standing just as the re-formed Free Worlds League had to relinquish the factory to the emerging Wolf Empire.
