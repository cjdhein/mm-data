<capabilities>
The Grenadier II has a Modular Weapon Mount in the left arm and a second mounted in the body. The right arm has a single Basic Manipulator.
</capabilities>

<overview>
The Grenadier II battle armor suit is an evolution of the Grenadier suit already in use by the AFFS.
</overview>

<deployment>
This variant carries a Battle Armor C3 System in the left arm and a Clan-spec LRM-4 with eight reloads on the body.
</deployment>

<history>
It uses lighter Clan-spec Standard Stealth armor mated to an Inner Sphere chassis to save weight. This allows the Grenadier II to pack as much firepower and protection as a Grenadier, but at a lighter weight. In addition, the lighter weight of the Grenadier II means it can be transported by OmniMechs.
