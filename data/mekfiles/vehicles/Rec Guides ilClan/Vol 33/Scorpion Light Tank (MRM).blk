<capabilities>
The Scorpion Light Tank's performance is modest, especially against similar light armor units. Its main weapon, the Deleon Autocannon, delivers limited damage at long ranges but struggles with accuracy at closer distances. The 20mm Gatling gun, though reliable, falls short compared to the secondary armaments typically found on other light tanks. The tank's lack of speed and weak armor present significant tactical challenges.<p>Complicating its operational efficacy is Quikscell Company's notorious reputation for inconsistent quality control. Many new Scorpions come with minor defects that require time-consuming troubleshooting and repairs, affecting their readiness for immediate deployment.</p>
</capabilities>

<overview>
The Scorpion Light Tank, originating from the Quikscell Company, is widely recognized as the "Budget Tank" for its affordability. This cost-effectiveness makes it a favored choice for less affluent worlds. Despite its cost advantages, the Scorpion is often utilized in large groups to offset its relative inferiority in power and defense compared to other vehicles in its class.
</overview>

<deployment>
The MRM Scorpion, emerging in 3060, represents an evolution in missile technology. By substituting the autocannon for an MRM-20 missile rack, along with increased ammunition storage, this variant becomes a formidable mid-range missile platform, balancing firepower with mobility.
</deployment>

<history>
Since its inception in 2807, the Scorpion Light Tank has been a ubiquitous element in military engagements across the Inner Sphere. Renowned for its widespread manufacture and deployment, the Scorpion has served in numerous armies, planetary militias, mercenary commands, and even in the ranks of bandits and pirates. Its affordability and ease of production have made it a common choice, particularly on poorer worlds where more advanced or expensive vehicles are not feasible.
